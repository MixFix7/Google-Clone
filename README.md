# Google Clone

Google Clone is a personal project developed by MixFix7, aiming to replicate the popular Google search engine using Django framework. This project includes features such as a conventional web search, image search, video search on YouTube, and a chat interface powered by GPT-3. Additionally, users can register on the website to personalize their experience.

# Features

Web Search: Users can perform text-based searches, similar to the functionality provided by the Google search engine. The search results are displayed in a familiar format, including relevant titles, descriptions, and URLs.

Image Search: Google Clone allows users to search for images using specific keywords. The application utilizes advanced algorithms to retrieve and display relevant images based on the user's search query.

Video Search: The project integrates with YouTube's API to enable users to search for videos on the platform. Users can enter keywords and receive a list of videos related to their search query, complete with titles, descriptions, and thumbnails.

Chat Interface with GPT-3: Google Clone incorporates a chat feature powered by GPT-3, an advanced language model developed by OpenAI. Users can engage in conversations with the AI chatbot, asking questions, seeking recommendations, or simply chatting with the AI.

User Registration: To enhance the user experience, Google Clone provides user registration functionality. Users can create an account, which enables them to save preferences, view search history, and customize their interaction with the website.

Technologies Used
Django: The project is built using the Django web framework, which provides a solid foundation for developing scalable and secure web applications.

Python: The backend logic of the application is written in Python, a powerful and versatile programming language.

HTML/CSS: The user interface is designed using HTML and CSS, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive layout for a seamless user experience.

JavaScript: The project incorporates JavaScript for interactive features and enhanced functionality.

OpenAI GPT-3: The chat interface utilizes GPT-3, an advanced natural language processing model developed by OpenAI, to provide intelligent responses and engage in meaningful conversations.
